# Main Team Settings

This page covers how to manage general settings for your team.

:::warning Important: Shared Resources ID vs. Friendly Name
When a Project Team is first created, a **Friendly Name** is generated based on the initial Team Name. This is the name that is shown across the People Portal when referring to your Project Team.

**Editing the Team Name does NOT change the Shared Resources ID.**

External services integrated with the People Portal rely on the **Shared Resources ID** to identify the team. This means that if you rename your team:

- **Slack Channels**: The names of existing Slack channels associated with the team will **not** change.
- **App Dev Git Organization**: The organization name/URL in App Dev Git will **not** change.
- **AWS Resources**: The names of your team's AWS accounts/resources will **not** change.

This behavior ensures that Shared Resource Client integrations (such as Slack and App Dev Git) do not break even if a team updates its display title.

## Changing Team Details

To update your Project Team's core information, go to **Organization > Teams**, select your team, click on **Settings**, and finally click **Edit Details**. You will be able to change the following.

- **Team Name**: The display name of your team as it appears throughout the People Portal UI.
- **Team Description**: A brief summary of the team's mission, stack, or scope.


## AWS Account Provisioning

In the **Team Settings** section, you will find a toggle to **Provision AWS Account**.

- **What it does**: When enabled, the People Portal automatically creates a dedicated AWS account for your Project Team. This account is isolated from other teams and comes with an initial budget limit.
- **Access**: Once provisioned, members can access your AWS environment via the **AWS Console** button on your team's dashboard (managed through the Bindle permission system).
